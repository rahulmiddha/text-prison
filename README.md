# text-prison

Basic state-machine based text adventure
This game is a very simple text adventure. The user will read the story and press a single key from a list of one or more. The computer then will display a new screen of text in response to this input. It is implemented as a finite-state machine which may have more more states added in the future.

# Our Story
You are a prisoner in a cell. Using the items next to you, you must escape.
